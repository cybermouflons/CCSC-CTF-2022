## Description
Ricks from various dimensions tried to enter the multiverse. 
Unfortunately their Mortys had previously messed around with their portal guns, 
leading their Ricks to enter a spiderverse and get abducted by Gromflomite assassins.
To lose their track, the assassins kept visiting different planets in the spiderverse.
However, Krombopulos Michael (the Gromflomite who abducted the Rick of our dimension),
was secretly leaving messages behind to help Morty find his Rick.
