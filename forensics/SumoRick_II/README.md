# SumoRick II
[This challenge will be available only when "SumoRick I" is solved]

**Category**: Forensics, Programming

**Author**: tratrafe2

**Difficulty**: Hard

## Description
In another dimension (let's call it meta-dimension), 
Ricks from various (regular) dimensions have tried to enter the multiverse.
Due to their Mortys' silliness, their portal gun accidentally led them to a spiderverse.

Again, Gromflomite assassins have abducted all Ricks. 
Nevertheless, in this meta-dimension, Gromflomites are smarter.
To lose their track, they made regular stops on planets (at most 5 seconds). Then, they purposely changed spaceships.

Just like in the SumoRick I meta-dimension, Krombopulos Michael (the Gromflomite who abducted the Rick of our dimension), was once again secretly leaving messages behind to help Morty find his Rick.

Note: The flag follows the typical format and contains no numbers.
