Linux_lsof plugin shows that the backd000r process has an opened file named s3cr3t.
Linux_Volshell plugin should be used to determine the inode number of the opened file.
Run the following commands in the volshell:
	cc(pid=1378)
	for fd in self._proc.lsof():
		//where fd is a tuple where the first entry is a linux_file object
		dt(fd[0])->f_inode is the inode number of the s3cr3t file
Dump the s3cr3t file using: volatility -f dump.mem --profile=LinuxDebian_3_16_0-11-amd64_profilex64 linux_find_file --inode=0xffff88001a785850 -O s3cr3t
